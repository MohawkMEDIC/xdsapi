# MEDIC XDS API

The MEDIC XDS Client API is a simple wrapper which allows users to easily create XDS Document Consumer or Document Source messages to be sent to an XDS document repository or registry. The API provides a series of helper methods which will construct the underlying XmlSerialization classes generated from IHE WSDLs.
